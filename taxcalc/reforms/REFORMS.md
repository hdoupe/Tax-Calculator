# HOW TO SPECIFY A TAX REFORM IN A JSON POLICY REFORM FILE

A tax reform consists of a collection of reform provisions.  There is
a way to specify in a text file the collection of reform provisions
that make up a reform proposal.  When stored on your local computer,
such reform files can be used to estimate reform effects either by
uploading to the [TaxBrain webapp](https://www.ospc.org/taxbrain/file/)
or by using the `--reform` option of the [Tax-Calculator command-line
tool,
tc](https://open-source-economics.github.io/Tax-Calculator/index.html#cli).

Here we provide links to several reform files that specify historical
reform proposals, and then provide a more general explanation of the
structure and syntax of reform files.

## Tax Reforms Defined Relative to TCJA Policy

Note that the current-law (that is, TCJA) values of each tax policy
parameter are shown in the [Policy Parameters section of the user
documentation](https://open-source-economics.github.io/Tax-Calculator/index.html#pol).

## Structure and Syntax of Reform Files

The reform files are JSON files.  JSON, which stands for JavaScript
Object Notation, is an easy and widely used way to specify structured
information.  First we provide an abstract example of a JSON reform
file with some explanation, and then we provide links to a few
hypothetical reform files that illustrate their expressive range.

Here is an abstract example of a tax reform proposal that consists of
several reform provisions.  The structure of this file is as follows:

```
{
  "policy": {
     <parameter_name>: {<calyear>: <parameter-value>,
                        ...,
                        <calyear>: <parameter-value>},
     <parameter_name>: {<calyear>: <parameter-value>},
     ...,
     <parameter_name>: {<calyear>: <parameter-value>,
                        ...,
                        <calyear>: <parameter-value>}
  }
}
```

Notice each pair of reform provision is separated by commas.
Each reform provision may have one or multiple year-value pairs.
Also, the <parameter_name> and <calyear> must be enclosed in quotes (").
The <parameter_value> is enclosed in single brackets when
the <parameter_value> is a scalar and enclosed in double brackets when
the <parameter_value> is a vector.  The most common vector of values
is one that varies by filing status (MARS) with the vector containing
five parameter values for single, married filing joint, married filing
separate, head of household, widow.

The following hypothetical payroll tax reforms, all of which are
defined relative to pre-TCJA policy, illustrate the flexibility that
reform files provide in expressing complex tax reforms.

[Raise OASDI maximum taxable earnings](ptaxes1.json)

[Eliminate OASDI maximum taxable earnings](ptaxes2.json)

thresholds and index thresholds](ptaxes3.json)
