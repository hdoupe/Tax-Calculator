This directory contains examples of policy reform files that can be
combined and modified to create your own policy reform files that
are stored on your local computer.

Such policy reform files can then be uploaded to the [TaxBrain
webapp](https://www.ospc.org/taxbrain/file/) for analysis, or be
analyzed on your local computer using the tc CLI (command-line
interface) to Tax-Calculator, as described in the [user
documentation](https://open-source-economics.github.io/Tax-Calculator/index.html#cli).

[This
document](https://github.com/open-source-economics/Tax-Calculator/blob/master/taxcalc/reforms/REFORMS.md#how-to-specify-a-tax-reform-in-a-json-policy-reform-file)
provides access to several reform files that represent recent tax
reform proposals.
