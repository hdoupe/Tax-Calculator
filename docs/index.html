<h3>What is Tax-Calculator?</h3>

<p>
  Tax-Calculator is an open-source microsimulation model for
  static analysis of USA federal income and payroll taxes.
</p>

<p>
  When using
  <a href="https://github.com/PSLmodels/taxdata#about-taxdata-repository"
     target="_blank">micro data</a> that represent the USA
    population, Tax-Calculator can estimate the aggregate revenue and
    distributional effects of tax reforms under static analysis
    assumptions.

<p>
  Tax-Calculator can also process custom-created data on one or more
  filing units permitting analysis of how tax reforms affect certain
  people.
</p>

<p>
  Tax-Calculator interacts with other models in the
  <a href="https://www.pslmodels.org/" target="_blank">
    Policy Simulation Library</a> to conduct non-static analysis.
</p>

<p>
  Tax-Calculator is transparent because its Python source code and
  embedded documentation are publicly available at the
  <a href="https://github.com/PSLmodels/Tax-Calculator" target="_blank">
  Tax-Calculator GitHub repository</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Tax-Calculator can simulate an enormous number of tax reforms
  because tax policy is parameterized using over 200 parameters that
  can be changed by users <b>without doing any programming</b>.
  And even a reform that is not able to be characterized using
  currently-available parameters can be simulated by writing
  supplementary Python code that characterizes the reform.
</p>

<p>
  Tax-Calculator can estimate for each filing unit the marginal tax
  rate generated by a small change in income.  Marginal tax rates can
  be generated for eighteen different kinds of income.  And marginal
  tax rates can be estimated under any parametric tax reform.
</p>

<p>
  Tax-Calculator is extensively tested using hundreds of unit and
  integration tests that achieve complete code coverage.  Also, there
  is an ongoing cross-model validation effort that uses large
  randomly-generated samples of filing units to compare results
  generated by Tax-Calculator with results from other tax models.
  The cross-model validation work with NBER's TAXSIM-27 model is
  described <a href="https://github.com/PSLmodels/Tax-Calculator/blob/master/taxcalc/validation/taxsim27/README.md#validation-of-tax-calculator-against-internet-taxsim-27"
  target="_blank">here</a>.

<h3>Disclaimer</h3>

<p>
  Results will change as Tax-Calculator data and logic improve. A
  fundamental reason for adopting open-source methods in this project
  is so that people from all backgrounds can contribute to the models
  that our society uses to assess economic policy; when
  community-contributed improvements are incorporated, the model will
  produce different results.
