<h3>Getting Started</h3>

<p>
  Tax-Calculator packages are available for Windows, Mac, and Linux
  computers that have the free Anaconda Python 3.6 or 3.7 distribution
  installed.  You can use Tax-Calculator without doing any Python
  programming, but the Anaconda distribution is required for
  Tax-Calculator to run.  Take the following four steps to get started.
</p>

<h4>1. Install Anaconda Python</h4>

<p>
  Download and install the free Anaconda distribution of Python 3.6 or
  3.7 from <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/download/"
  target="_blank">Anaconda</a>.  You must do this even if you already
  have Python installed on your computer because the Anaconda
  distribution contains all the additional Python packages that
  Tax-Calculator uses to conduct its calculations (many of which are
  not included in other Python installations).  You can install the
  Anaconda distribution without having administrative privileges on
  your computer and the Anaconda distribution will not interfere with
  any Python installation that came as part of your computer's
  operating system.
</p>

<h4>2. Download Tax-Calculator Package</h4>

<p>
  Download a Tax-Calculator <kbd>taxcalc</kbd> package for your
  computer by executing this command from the command prompt:
  <pre>
    conda install -c PSLmodels taxcalc
  </pre>
  This command will also install all the Python packages required by
  Tax-Calculator.
</p>

<h4>3. Become a Registered GitHub User</h4>

<p>
  Open a free GitHub account so that you can communicate with
  Tax-Calculator developers.  This is by far the easiest way to ask
  questions, make suggestions, or report bugs.  Not only does this put
  you into direct contact with Tax-Calculator developers, it allows
  the community of more experienced users, all of whom are watching
  the Tax-Calculator GitHub repository, to answer your questions.
  You can create an account at the
  <a href="https://github.com/join" target="_blank">Join GitHub</a>
  webpage.  And then you can specify how you want to <q>watch</q> the
  Tax-Calculator repository by clicking on the <em>Watch</em> button
  in the upper-right corner of the
  <a href="https://github.com/PSLmodels/Tax-Calculator"
     target="_blank">Tax-Calculator main page</a>.
</p>
  
<h4>4. Read Tax-Calculator User Guide</h4>

<p>
  Read the <a href="uguide.html" target="_blank">user guide</a> about
  how to conduct tax analysis with Tax-Calculator two different ways:
  (a) without doing any computer programming, or (b) by writing Python
  programs.  Then after reading the
  <a href="tc_overview.html">Structural Overview</a>, you will be in
  a position to do any of the following:
</p>

<ol>
  <li><p>
      If you want to <b>ask a question</b>, create a new issue
      <a href="https://github.com/PSLmodels/Tax-Calculator/issues"
         target="_blank">here</a> posing your question about
      Tax-Calculator as clearly as possible.
  </p></li>
  <li><p>
      If you want to <b>request an enhancement</b>, create a new issue
      <a href="https://github.com/PSLmodels/Tax-Calculator/issues"
         target="_blank">here</a> providing details on what you think
      should be added to Tax-Calculator.
  </p></li>
  <li><p>
      If you want to <b>report a bug</b>, create a new issue
      <a href="https://github.com/PSLmodels/Tax-Calculator/issues"
         target="_blank">here</a> providing details on what you think is
      wrong with Tax-Calculator.  An ideal bug report demonstrates for a
      single filing unit that a Tax-Calculator result is not the same as
      what you get when filling out the relevant IRS tax form.
  </p></li>
  <li><p>
      If you want to <b>propose code changes</b>, follow the directions in the
      <a href="https://github.com/PSLmodels/Tax-Calculator/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#tax-calculator-contributor-guide"
         target="_blank">contributor guide</a> on how to fork and
      clone the Tax-Calculator git repository.  Before developing
      any code changes be sure to read completely the contributor
      guide.
