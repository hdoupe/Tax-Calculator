Tax-Calculator 
==============

The Tax-Calculator simulates the US federal individual income and
payroll tax system.  In conjunction with micro data that represent the
USA population and a set of behavioral assumptions, the Tax-Calculator
can be used to conduct revenue scoring and distributional analyses of
tax policies.  The Tax-Calculator is written in Python, an interpreted
language that can execute on Windows, Mac, or Linux.

This documentation is about **developing** Tax-Calculator.  If you
just want to **use** Tax-Calculator to conduct tax analysis, read this
`user documentation`_.

If you are relying on Tax-Calculator capabilities in your own project,
be sure to read the definition of the `Tax-Calculator Public API`_.
