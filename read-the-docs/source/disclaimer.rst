The Tax-Calculator is currently under development.  Users should be
forewarned that the taxcalc API (application programming interface)
could change significantly.  Additionally, the implementation is
subject to substantial change. 

Proper use of this tool and a description of that use is ultimately
your responsibility. If you plan on publishing your results, it is
highly recommended that you confirm with the community that you are
using the tools properly and interpreting the results properly before
you publish them. If you have a compelling reason not to leave a
public note on the `mailing list`_, email Matt at matt.jensen@aei.org.

Results will change as the underlying model and data improve. A fundamental
reason for adopting open source methods in this project is so that
people from all backgrounds can contribute to the models that our
society uses to assess economic policy; when community-contributed
improvements are incorporated, the model will produce different results.

A suggested acknowledgement is, "The author wishes to thank the 
Tax-Calculator community for making the model available, however the author
remains responsible for the use of the model and any conclusions drawn."
